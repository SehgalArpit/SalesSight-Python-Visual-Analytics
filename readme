# Sales Data Visualization

## Project Overview

This project is focused on visualizing and analyzing sales data of a pharmaceutical company for the years 2015 and 2016. Using Python and various libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the objective is to create a dynamic dashboard with key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizations that help explore sales trends, identify contributing factors, and provide insights for decision-making.

The goal of this project is to make sales data easier to understand through visual representations, which can aid decision-makers in identifying patterns, trends, and areas that need improvement.

## Objectives

- **Compare Sales by Region for 2016 vs 2015**: Using bar charts to compare sales across different regions.
- **Contributing Factors to Sales for Each Region in 2016**: Displaying the distribution of sales across regions with pie charts.
- **Comparison of Total Sales (2015 vs 2016)**: Breaking down sales by region and tier.
- **Identify Decline in Sales in the East Region**: Finding which state in the East region experienced a decline in sales.
- **Decline in Units Sold in High Tier Divisions**: Identifying divisions with reduced unit sales in 2016.
- **Quarterly Sales Visualization**: Creating bar plots and pie charts to analyze sales by quarter.
- **Dynamic Dashboard**: Offering a comprehensive analysis of the sales data across regions, tiers, and time frames.
